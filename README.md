# Stocks Project
This project was created by Group 2, Matt Westelman, Vanessa Brewer and Elena Shchepotkina.

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the use of the yFinance module in python, 
and the use of Flask in python to create a simple web page.

## Features:
The website has several features:

An interactive graph of securities to be selected, that can be zoomed, panned

A button to change webpages to a list of stocks, and information on them

Buttons to change the colors of the website

## Requirements:
Requires Python version 3

Modules required to pip install:

flask

sqlite3

pandas

numpy

plotly

plotly.express

## Usage:
Ensure modules specified are pip installed to device

Download and extract the entire Github repository

Open app.py and run (see notes*)

Open terminal and follow the link

If the website does not populate, run app.py with anaconda-shell (open terminal follow link)

Click the securities on the graph to turn them on and off 

Graphs controls are on the top right of the graph

Click the buttons to navigate the website or to add colors


## Notes:

*DO NOT use live server to host the website, it will run, but not everything will populate
